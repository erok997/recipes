1 tablespoon chili powder
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon paprika (I used Smoked Paprika)
1 and 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 to 1 teaspoon sea salt (more or less to taste)
1 teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
1. In small bowl, mix all ingredients and store in airtight container. (Or you can mix it together in the container you are going to store it inâ€“just give it a shake!)
2. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of this mixture plus 1/2 to 3/4 cup of water to one pound of cooked meat (of your choice). Simmer over medium heat, stirring frequently until there is very little liquid left in the pan.
3. Serve with your favorite taco toppings! I recommend lots of sour cream, fresh salsa, guacamole, lettuce, cheese and tomato.

Note: Add a tablespoon of all-purpose flour to the pound of cooked meat to thicken up the mixture a bit.
